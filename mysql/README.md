# Introduction

1.  The mysql_data.zip file contains a directory named 'mysql_data' that stores data collected from yfinance APIs and stored in the database before April 18th. To use this data, extract the zip file in the current directory. If you don't need this data, you can delete the zip file or the 'mysql_data' directory. After deleting the directory, build or restart the container.

2. The mysql_init directory includes the SQL file required to initialize the MySQL tables and users.

3. The config folder contains the files necessary to configure the settings of MySQL.
